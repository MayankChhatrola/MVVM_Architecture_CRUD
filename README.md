## Features
- Demonstrates the MVVM architectural pattern.
- Complete CRUD operations with a local database.
- Clean and modular codebase for better readability and maintainability.
- Integration with ViewModel, LiveData, and Repository patterns.
- Fully written in Java.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to help developers learn and understand the MVVM architecture in Android. It provides a hands-on example to grasp:
- How to separate concerns in an Android application.
- The role of each component in the MVVM architecture.
- How to integrate CRUD operations into an MVVM-based application.

## Requirements
- **Android Studio**: Flamingo | Giraffe (or higher).
- **Minimum SDK Version**: 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop).
- **Java Version**: Java 8 or higher.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
